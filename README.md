# Absinthe

Absinthe is a lightweight IoC container for Ruby applications.

## Philosophy

Absinthe is designed around the premise that all metaprogramming in a Ruby application must be done via IoC if it is to be reliable, performant, or testable.

## Status

The project is currently experimental and should not be used for production applications.

## Licence

The 'new' or '3 clause' BSD licence, see LICENCE for details.
